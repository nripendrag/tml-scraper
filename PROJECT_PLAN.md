# FleetEdge Automated Data Scraper - Project Plan

## Project Overview
Develop an automated web scraper for Tata Motors Fleet Edge website to extract mileage analysis data with manual captcha handling.

## Technical Requirements Analysis

### 1. Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Automation**: Selenium WebDriver
- **Browser**: Chrome/Firefox (to be determined)
- **Additional Libraries**: 
  - `requests` (for session management if needed)
  - `pandas` (for data processing)
  - `time`/`datetime` (for delays and timestamps)
  - `os` (for file handling)
  - `configparser` or `python-dotenv` (for configuration)

### 2. Project Structure (Proposed)

```

## Critical Questions & Requirements

### Website Analysis Questions
1. **FleetEdge URL**: What is the exact login URL for Tata Motors Fleet Edge?
2. **Authentication Type**: 
   - Is it a standard username/password login?
   - What type of captcha is used (image, text, reCAPTCHA)?
3. **Element Identification**: 
   - What are the HTML element IDs/classes for username, password, and captcha fields?
   - What is the login button identifier?
4. **Post-Login Navigation**:
   - What is the URL structure after successful login?
   - How to navigate to mileage analysis section?
   - What are the element identifiers for data filters and download button?

### Data Requirements
5. **Data Filters**:
   - What date range options are available?
   - Are there vehicle-specific filters?
   - What data format is downloaded (CSV, Excel, PDF)?
6. **Download Behavior**:
   - Does the download trigger automatically?
   - Is there a specific download directory?
   - What is the file naming convention?

### Security & Compliance
7. **Rate Limiting**: Are there any rate limits or anti-bot measures?
8. **Session Management**: How long do sessions remain active?
9. **Legal Compliance**: Do we have permission to scrape this data?

### Technical Configuration
10. **Browser Preferences**:
    - Headless vs headed browser operation?
    - Download directory configuration
    - Browser profile requirements
11. **Error Handling**:
    - How to handle network timeouts?
    - Captcha retry mechanism
    - Login failure scenarios

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
- [ ] Set up Python virtual environment
- [ ] Install required dependencies
- [ ] Configure WebDriver (ChromeDriver/GeckoDriver)
- [ ] Create project directory structure

### Phase 2: Website Analysis
- [ ] Manual exploration of FleetEdge login process
- [ ] Identify and document all web elements
- [ ] Test different browsers for compatibility
- [ ] Document the complete user journey

### Phase 3: Core Development
- [ ] Implement configuration management
- [ ] Create WebDriver initialization
- [ ] Develop login automation (without captcha)
- [ ] Implement captcha handling mechanism
- [ ] Create navigation to mileage analysis section

### Phase 4: Data Extraction
- [ ] Implement date range selection
- [ ] Add filter configuration
- [ ] Automate download process
- [ ] Implement file verification and organization

### Phase 5: Error Handling & Robustness
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement logging system
- [ ] Create retry mechanisms
- [ ] Add session recovery features

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Test with different scenarios
- [ ] Optimize wait times and performance
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create user documentation

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Website Changes**: FleetEdge UI modifications breaking selectors
2. **Anti-Bot Measures**: Detection and blocking of automated access
3. **Captcha Complexity**: Changes in captcha implementation
4. **Legal Issues**: Terms of service violations

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Flexible Element Selection**: Use multiple selector strategies
2. **Human-like Behavior**: Random delays, mouse movements
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms for failures
4. **Compliance Monitoring**: Regular review of website terms

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions Required**:
   - Provide FleetEdge website credentials for testing
   - Share the exact website URL and user journey
   - Confirm legal permission for data scraping

2. **Information Gathering**:
   - Manual walkthrough of the complete process
   - Screenshot critical pages for element identification
   - Document any specific business requirements

3. **Technical Decisions**:
   - Choose browser (Chrome recommended for better automation support)
   - Decide on headless vs headed operation
   - Set up development environment

## Questions for User

Please provide the following information to proceed:

1. **Website Access**: 
   - FleetEdge login URL
   - Test credentials (or confirm you'll provide them)
   
2. **Data Requirements**:
   - What specific mileage data do you need?
   - What date ranges are typical?
   - How often will this scraper run?

3. **Technical Preferences**:
   - Do you prefer the browser to be visible during operation?
   - Where should downloaded files be stored?
   - Do you need email notifications for completed downloads?

4. **Operational Context**:
   - Will this run on your local machine or a server?
   - Do you need scheduling capabilities?
   - What's your Python experience level?
